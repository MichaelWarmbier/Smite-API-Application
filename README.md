# Smite-API-Application
A Node based application designed to make accessing the Smite API easier.

## Using application through Repl.it

Visit [this location](https://replit.com/@Kirbout/Smite-API-Application) and run the application that way. See "Using the application" below.

## Installation

### Install Node.js

Node can be installed on **Windows** by going to the [download Page](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Node can be installed on Ubuntu Linux by running the following command on the terminal:

`sudo apt install nodejs`

You may need to enter in your user password due to the sudo command.

### Windows

Download the repository as a .zip file and extract it's contents to a preferred location.

Locate the smite-api.js file. Right click on the file, click on "Open With", then select Node.js JavaScript Runtime. You may also want to set Windows to always open files with the .js extension using Node.

### Linux

Download the repository as a .zip file and extract it's contents to a preferred location. Navigate to that location using the terminal and run it with the following command:

`node smite-api.js`

### Using the application

Currently, there are only two prompts to fill out. Your DevID and your Authentication Key which can be received by registering as an API developer through Smite themselves. A link to the documentation can be found [here](https://webcdn.hirezstudios.com/hirez-studios/legal/smite-api-developer-guide.pdf)

Follow the prompts on screen and make your selections. If you run this application through Repl, you may have to fork the project before you can actually get any of the output files.

Right now the only information this tool can access are the gods and items information, however more commands are being planned for the future.
